## Von Neumann's Architecture
Historically, there are two types of computers:
1. Fixed Programmed Computers, which cannot be reprogrammed, e.g. calculators.
2. Stored Programmed Computers, whose storage modules store the programs.

Von Neumann Bottlenecks:
1. Instructions are executed only one at a time
2. Instructions can only be carried out sequentially
