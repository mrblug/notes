### 1.1 The tower of Hanoi
The problem is to move all the plates in one peg to another without breaking the rule that smaller plates are put on larger ones.  
To solve this problem, one should agree that without moving the bottom largest plate to the target peg, the mission is impossible.  
Only have the smaller plates been moved to and put well on the third peg can one move the largest plate to the target peg.
